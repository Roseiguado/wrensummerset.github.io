# About me

My name is Wren Summerset.  I have been an online ESL instructor for the past 2 1/2 years which allowed me to be an at home
mom to my 3 little yahoos. I'm on a journey to become self directing.  In the past my story was largely scripted by others. 
I finally see that this was not in my best interest, nor did it serve my children/family, as I once believed.  
I'm learning to flex and stretch beyond the boundaries that were set for me.


#Goals

My goal with Ctrl+Shift Code school is to use the resources available to me to empower myself with the skills and tools 
that will allow me to go out into the world on my own terms.  I hope to one day be able to turn around and offer the same to 
others.
